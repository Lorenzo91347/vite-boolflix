# Boolflix(in progress)

The Idea behind this project is to create a movie database using the TMDB Open Api,to render a list of movies and Tv series 
based on your search.

At the moment it strictly includes the bare functioning components,thanks to Axios Api calls and methods native to Vue.

Developed with Vue and Vite(Node.js),see the .drawio file attached for a diagram.
